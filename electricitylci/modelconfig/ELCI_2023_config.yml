# MODEL CONFIG FILE
# This file contains parameters that can be changed by a user.

# MODEL AND DATA YEARS
# These parameters determine what year the outputs represent and which years
# of data are used from each source.

# The target year is used to determine the temporal correlation of data with
# the electricity generation processes, which can be used in uncertainty
# calculations.
electricity_lci_target_year: 2025

# Select a regional aggregation from "eGRID", "NERC", "BA", "US", "FERC",
# and "EIA". The EPA_eGRID trading method can only be used with "eGRID".
# The NETL_BA_trading method can only be used with "BA" and "FERC".
regional_aggregation: 'BA'

# If egrid is not used as a primary data source then set "replace_egrid"
# to True. This will trigger the use of EPA CEMS and EIA data as substitutes
# for eGRID. Replacing eGRID will also use EIA generation data to determine
# the generation mix.

eia_gen_year: 2023
replace_egrid: true

# In 2023, NETL published the Cradle-to-Gate Life Cycle Analysis Baseline
# for U.S. Coal Mining and Delivery (https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2370100),
# which supersedes the 2020 model inventory used in the original baseline.
# Select between the 2020 and 2023 model inventories. This impacts both
# the mining and transportation LCIs, but does not impact the coal power plant
# construction LCI.
coal_model_year: 2023

# NETL developed profiles for renewable generation to capture construction
# and O&M impacts (e.g., solar PV manufacturing and power plant operations).
# There are two vintages for renewable inventories: 2016 and 2020. The 2016
# inventories combine construction and operations (recommended for use when
# re-creating the 2016 baseline). In the 2020 inventory, these were separated
# into individual inventories (recommended for future baselines).

# NETL has developed profiles for power plant water use.
# Set to true to include these impacts.

# API DATA SOURCES
# If replacing eGRID, then EPA CEMS from CAMPD is used. This data is available
# from EPA's API (https://www.epa.gov/power-sector/cam-api-portal). Request
# for a free API key and copy-and-paste it here:
epa_cam_api: ""

# If using NETL's trading method, then EIA bulk U.S. Electric System
# Operating Data are used. The data are available in two formats:
# bulk zip (EBA.zip) and Opendata API. Choose the path (note that since
# March 2024, both routes include data from 2019). To get 2016-2018 data,
# use the archived bulk zip file (`use_eia_bulk_zip` = true) and bypass the
# vintage check (`bypass_vintage_check` = true). The vintage check triggers
# a new download of EBA.zip every 30 days, as defined by VINTAGE_THRESH
# global parameter in `bulk_eia_data` and the EBA manifest text file.
# To register for a free API key, go to: https://www.eia.gov/opendata/, and
# copy-and-paste it for `eia_api` below.

# GENERATOR FILTERS
# These parameters determine if any power plants are filtered out
include_only_egrid_facilities_with_positive_generation: true
filter_on_efficiency: true
egrid_facility_efficiency_filters:
  lower_efficiency: 10
  upper_efficiency: 100

# ELCI creates life cycle processes for each fuel type. If you only want to
# include power plants with a minimum amount of generation from a single fuel,
# make sure this parameter is set to true.
filter_on_min_plant_percent_generation_from_primary_fuel: true
min_plant_percent_generation_from_primary_fuel_category: 90

# If the parameter above is set to true, one may still want to keep the plants
# that do not meet the threshold. This setting will mark those power plants as
# MIXED and generate life cycle processes for them. Note that the definition
# of mixed is purposefully ambiguous and will mean different things depending
# on the region of aggregation.
keep_mixed_plant_category: true

# To ensure consistency with eGRID, the model applies a filter to remove
# industrial cogeneration facilities from the EIA Form 923 data based on
# their NAICS code (i.e., code 22: Electricity Utilities and Independent
# Power Producers) and by EIA sector numbers 1 and 2. This filter is
# designed to reproduce the same power plants that are listed in eGRID.
filter_non_egrid_emission_on_NAICS: true


# TRANSMISSION AND ELECTRICITY TRADING
# These parameters are used to determine which method of electricity trading is
# used and what losses from electricity distribution are included in the
# results.

# Used to compute the loss factor for transmission and distribution
# (i.e., 1/efficiency).
efficiency_of_distribution_grid: 0.95

# Electricity trading can be calculated using a method from EPA (with or
# without a surplus trading pool) that is based on eGRID regions or a method
# from NETL that uses an input-output approach using exchange data between
# balancing authorities from EIA. If false, net trading is used.
EPA_eGRID_trading: false

# For net trading, select between two options for for consumption mix
# calculations: net trading (true) or gross trading (false) between NERC
# and eGRID regions.
net_trading: false

# Trading year for EIA data used for net trading.
NETL_IO_trading_year: 2023


# POST PROCESSING
# This triggers a cleaning of the JSON-LD (e.g., removing untracked flows
# zero value product flows, and renumbering the exchange table internal IDs).
# These end processes help remove common errors that crash openLCA v2.
# Product systems for the at-user consumption mixes are also generated.
