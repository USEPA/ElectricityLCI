    Flow-level data quality scores are assigned to each elementary flow
    exchange and process-level scores to each process using the USEPA LCA Data
    Quality Assessment guidance
    (https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryId=321834).
    In the generation processes, for each emission factor, five data quality
    scores were assigned on flow-level data quality scoring. Process data
    quality scores draw on the process US EPA DQ indicator guidance. Process
    completeness is calculated by first creating a list of expected flows for
    each fuel type. U.S. average profiles for the fuels used in electricity
    generation are developed for expected flows in the following categories:
    greenhouse gases (GHG), CAPs, toxic and hazardous air pollutants (HAP),
    toxic water discharges, toxic soil releases, and hazardous waste. To
    determine the expected flows in each category the number of flows reported
    in the underlying data sources NEI, TRI, eGRID, RCRAInfo are summed across
    eGRID subregions by fuel type. Expected flows by fuel type for other inputs
    and outputs including intermediate inputs, raw energy demands, and water
    inputs are determined based on flows reported for the relevant electricity
    generation fuel type in existing LCI datasets such as ANL''s GREET model,
    NREL''s USLCI, and ecoinvent. Expected nutrient discharges to water are
    derived from a sample of electric facilities reporting to USEPA''s
    Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR). The actual flows evaluated for each fuel
    type by eGRID subregion can then be documented and compared to the U.S.
    average electrical fuel generation profiles to determine the overall
    process completeness according to the method described in USEPA LCA Data
    Quality Assessment guidance. Air emission flow data collection scores can
    also draw on these fuel-specific profiles by documenting whether an
    expected flow is being reported by the fuel type in the relevant eGRID
    subregion. An expected emission may not be captured if there are
    discrepancies between the facilities covered in eGRID and those reporting
    to the USEPA databases TRI, NEI, RCRAInfo. '

    an assumed 30 year life. The aggregation performed in the electricity LCI

  DataDocumentor: 'NETL'

  DataTreatment: 'Material requirements to construct the solar PV panels and
    the balance of system are calculated using plant capacity and local
    insolation estimates to scale the inventories from the referenced studies.
    The total inventory from construction and operations over the plant life
    are then divided by the assumed 30 year lifetime to provide emissions per
    year. When these emissions are divided by the generation for the specified
    year in the electricity baseline code, the inventory is placed on the basis
    of 1 MWh.'

  DataSelection: 'Where possible data is sourced from freely available life
    cycle data, such as NETL unit processes or USLCI. If the material was not
    available there then ecoinvent processes are used.'

  DataCollectionPeriod: '2018'

  sampling_procedure :
    - 'BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

      The boundaries include power plant construction with all known material
      inputs (e.g., steel, glass, concrete) and some minor material
      requirements and fuel combustion for plant operation. '

    - 'DATA COLLECTION

      Data for the material inputs to the plant are from:
      NETL unit processes, US LCI, and ecoinvent.
