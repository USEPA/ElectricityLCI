# Electricity_LCI_EPA_Emissions
Gather and process emissions and release data for electricity generation facilities in the EPA eGRID database from eGRID and the National Emissions Inventory, Toxi Release Inventory and Discharge Monitoring Report. The facility emissions and releases are then aggregated by fuel type and eGRID subregion to provide fuel input and emissions and release amounts for life cycle inventory (LCI) unit processes for electricity.

This project is a collaboration between US EPA ORD, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the National Energy Technology Laboratory, and other collaborators. The goal of the project is to create an LCI model of electricity for the Federal LCA Commons.
